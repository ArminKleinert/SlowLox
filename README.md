# RbLox
A 1-to-1 conversion of JLox to Ruby.

For the original code see https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters

With this conversion I tried to stick closely to the Java sources so
that beginners can easily read and understand both.

Sometimes I decided to use a different functionality or a shortcut to
achieve the same goal. For those cases I added a lot of documentation
including links to https://ruby-doc.org/ and relevant questions on
stackoverflow.

The coding style is not consistent because I am working on this code at
differing times and without touching files that I am done with again.

When I am done with this, I will try to aggressively optimize the code with less care
for style-guides and the original code.
